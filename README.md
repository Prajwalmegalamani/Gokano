What is Gokano?
Gokano is a website which allows you to earn some points by completing some very easy tasks like Daily Logging, Daily Poll, Social Missions, etc. The points that we earn are called 'GN Points'. The more points you earn, the more prizes you earn.
 
 How to collect GN Points:
 1) Login and click on 'Collect Daily Points'.
 2) Complete the Missions.
 3) Invite some Friends.
 
 However there is also another type of Points called 'VP Points'.
 These points are not very easy to earn, but once you have earned VP Points then you get products anytime. But as in GN Points you will have to wait for a while.
