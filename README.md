# Gokano Automator
Automation Software for Gokano.

What is Gokano?

Gokano is a website which allows you to earn some points by completing some very easy tasks like Daily Logging, Daily Poll, Social Missions, etc. The points that we earn are called 'GN Points'. The more points you earn, the more prizes you get.
 
# How to collect GN Points:
 1) Login and click on 'Collect Daily Points'.
 2) Complete the Missions.
 3) Invite some Friends.
 
However there is also another type of Points called 'VP Points'.
These points are not very easy to earn, but once you have earned VP Points then you get products anytime. But as in GN Points you will have to wait for a while.

# What does our project do?
So to do all of the above tasks, you will need to login and click on 'Collect Daily Points' and the you will have to wait for a day to click on that button again. But our software makes it easy for you. It stores your time and automatically clicks on 'Collect Daily Points'. Pretty useful right.
